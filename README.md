# Utopia-MagnoLeite-Challenge
Challenge code for Utopia Interview

First of all thanks for the opportunity to share a bit of my expertise through these so well created challenges.
I have implemented the codes and had success with the final results.
While programming, I tried to change as less as possible the main structure. I didn't create much validations, just assumed that the main code would have always the correct data, and more static then dinamic. Anyway, it will be a chance to discuss each point of the implementation.
